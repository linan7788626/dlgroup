## Build Community of Practice

- ### Common domain of knowledge  

- ### Community fosters interactions and sharing ideas  

- ### The community is centered around practice  

---
## Benefits of a CoP for Deep Learning
- ### Build a network of deep learning professionals  

- ### Shared knowledge  

- ### Develop your own skillset in deep learning

- ### Deep learning is not something you learn, its something you do

# 2. Introduction to Deep Learning 
---

##Demo with playground.tensorflow.org  

- ### Big data

- ### Better processing with GPUs

- ### Better algorithms

- ### Not for every (or even most) problems


---

## Convolutional neural networks

- ### Long history, but relevant recently because of Alexnet (2012) 

- ### Blew away past benchmarks

---

## Recurrent neural networks

- ### Learn sequential data

- ### Blew away past benchmarks in nlp, speech  . . .

- ### Again infrastructure/data/algorithms accelerated progress

- ### Alpha Go

# 3. Expectations and Format
---
layout: false
## Format

- ### Meet regularly (every two weeks)

- ### Share and discuss developments around deep learning from a practitioner perspective

- ### Understand these technologies and how we can apply them

---
## Next few months

- ### Spend two sessions on convolutional neural networks, then two sessions on recurrent neural networks, and then two sessions on reinforcement learning

- ### I will lead the first session of the pair by providing some background and simple running code

- ### You will be expected to develop a new wrinkle and share it with the group at the second session

---

## Expectations

- ### Deep learning is a huge and growing field, you will not be able to even absorb 5% of everything going 

- ### If you are new to machine learning, you will have to learn to drink from a fire-hose

- ### Don't expect everything to go smoothly, but this is how you really learn

---


## For next time

- ### Run the notebook from: https://github.com/rajshah4/image_keras

- ### Instructions are there, but you will need a machine running python and need to install docker

- ### Also take some time to learn about convolutional neural networks

- ### To get help and share ideas, please use the Slack group: `d-l-group`
